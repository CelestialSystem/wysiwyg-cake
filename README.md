# Froala WYSIWYG Editor Plugin for CakePHP

## About

The purpose of placing <a href="https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor"/>Froala WYSIWYG Editor</a> in a plugin is to keep it separate from a themed view, the regular webroot or the app in general, which makes it easier to update and overall follows the idea of keeping the code clean and modular.
